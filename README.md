Adopt a Goat :goat:
===================

This repository contains a bootstrap application featuring a small goat
adoption form. Your task is to structure a framework for a testing suite and
begin to build some basic tests against the application.


#### Requirements

- Structure a testing suite using Selenium (you may use the programming language
  of your choice).
- Add one test that validates the form's happy-path (i.e. submitting it
  successfully without errors).
- Add one test that validates appropriate user feedback when an error occurs
  that prevents happy-path submission.
- Add TODOs and comments that define the specifications for tests that would
  highlight edge cases and incorrect inputs.
- Update or include a new README with instructions on how to run the test suite


#### Guidelines

- Open `<path-to-project>/index.html` in a browser to view the adoption form.
- `*` Denotes a required field.
- Tests should automate filling out the form.
- Submitting the form should take users to a confirmation page.
- Completed projects should be packaged and emailed to `devs@logicgate.com`.


#### Evaluation

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate your ability to identify points of
failure in a web application and design tests to validate appropriate
functionality. We are looking for problem solving and meticulous thinking
above proficiency in any particular programming language. As such, the verbal
TODOs that outline future tests are just as important as the actual tests that
you create.

We will also be evaluating the organizational structure of your test suite.
Clean code and attention to reusability goes a long way.

Don't hesitate to leave comments that explain your thought process. The more we
understand your thought process the easier it is to follow your submission.
Also, if you find yourself stuck or the instructions seem unclear please reach
out to `devs@logicgate.com` with questions.
