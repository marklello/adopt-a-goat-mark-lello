Adopt a Goat :goat:
===================

This is repository contains a bootstrap application featuring a small goat
adoption form. Your task is to structure a framework for a testing suite and
begin to build some basic tests against the application.


#### Requirements

- Structure a testing suite using Selenium (you may use the programming language
  of your choice).
- Add a few tests that validate the form's happy-path.
- Add TODOs and comments that define the specifications for tests that would
highlight edge cases and incorrect inputs.


#### Guidelines

- Open `<path-to-project>/index.html` in a browser to view the goat form.
- `*` Denotes a required field.
- Tests should automate filling out the form.
- Submitting the form should take users to a confirmation page.
- Completed projects should be packaged and emailed to `devs@logicgate.com`.


#### Evaluation

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate your ability to identify points of
failure in a web application and design the appropriate tests to validate
appropriate functionality. We are looking for problem solving and meticulous
 thinking above proficiency in any particular programming language. As such,
 the verbal TODOs that outline future tests are just as important as the actual
 tests that you create.

We will also be evaluating the organizational structure of your test suite.
Clean code and attention to reusability goes a long way.

Don't hesitate to leave comments along the way that explain your thought
process. The more we understand your thought process the easier it is to follow
your submission. Also, if you find yourself stuck or the instructions seem
unclear please reach out to `devs@logicgate.com` with questions.
